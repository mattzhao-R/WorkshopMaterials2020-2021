# Practice Exercises for Workshop 4

# Save all your graphs to your output folder; data that is not native to R can 
# be found in the data folder for Workshop 4

# Note that you will probably want to use some of the data manipulation 
# techniques from Workshop 3 to better prepare your data for graphing

# Go to the link below, go through last year's ggplot tutorial: 
# https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PySdQOFSgG4S4KPqT2MxfQyNJPxfO90S/view?usp=sharing

# Try making those same graphs (or as similar as possible) without using ggplot2

# Make a plot using four variables from the txhousing dataset

# Find a way to effectively demonstrate the differences in median price between
# the cities in the dataset in a graph

# Using the data in cps.csv in your data folder: 
# Make a graph to examine how labor income changes based on age, sex, race, and 
# ethnicity

# Make a graph to look at how total income changes across states 

# Make a graph that examines the college premium

# Make a graph that examines the gender wage gap

# Have fun making more graphs!
